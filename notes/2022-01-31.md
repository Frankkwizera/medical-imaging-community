## Agenda

* DICOM Lookup tables 
  * What do they mean?  VOI LUT, Modality LUT, Presentation LUT
  * Sometimes they toggle on/off
  * Table transform from source pixel values into whatever you want to display
  * e.g. for an unsigned CT raw pixel into hounsfield
    * 0->-1024
    * 1024->0
    * 2048->1024
  * Four Types
    * Modality LUT - Transform between raw values (x7fe0,0010) and something more standardized (e.g. CT HU). 
        * Rescale Slope/Intercept is a linear transform
    * VOI LUT - Values of interest (e.g. WW/WC - bone, abdomen, lung, brain)
    * Presentation LUT - Converts rest of values into something display can show
      * e.g. MONOCHROME1 (white->black) - can invert
      * It is sometimes implicit, explicit (invert), full LUT
    * Color LUT - maps input as single value to RGB

  * https://github.com/cornerstonejs/cornerstone/blob/master/src/internal/generateLut.js
  * https://github.com/PantelisGeorgiadis/dcmjs-imaging

* Multimedia Report
  * Came up with a clinical use case

* static-wado and p10 update - 5m
  * Java and JS version are child projects of OHIF
  * Lots of enhancements made
    * Change to the structure of the output so they can be served by OHIF
      * OHIF testing can use the output of dicom-static-web
 * HELP WANTED - Looking for additional test data:
   * ECG
   * PDF
   * Video (short) - can someone do a 1 minute intro to OHIF as MPEG

* SIIM Blockchain Working Group - 5m
  * SIIM Hackathon related - eduction focused than competitive
  * Try to keep it interesting by adding new technology
    * Want to make them highly accessible - demystify
  * Two new initiatives this year
    * Open Source Data Set - FHIR + DICOM (fictional patients)
      * In the process of adding "enterprise imaging type data" to those images
      * In the past - just radiology.  Working on adding dermatology, pathology, etc
    * Blockchain 
      * Spun off a working group to figure out how to do this
      * First meeting was last week
      * Decided to create a SIIM specific Ethereum network
      * Will have a few sample applications
        * Use Case: Verify Radiologist Credentials
        * Use Case: Verify codvid vaccination certificates
      * Will also have option for people to devlop their own apps and explore other uses cases
  * Reach out to Mohannad if you are interested in helping out!
