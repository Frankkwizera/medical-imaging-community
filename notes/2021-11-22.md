Agenda Items:

* Database and metadata related issues with DICOM
  * https://github.com/MGHComputationalPathology/dicomweb-client/issues/57
  * S3 Native DICOM Web Adapter DICOMWeb Client (Python Client)
  * Is a database still a bottleneck for QIDO-RS only?
    * Is there alternative architectures?  Pregenerated data?
  * Three levels of queries (non relational)
    * Patient/Study
    * Series
    * SOP Instance
  * Question: DICOM in the real world has data missing - is this normal?
    * Answer: yes unfortunately, each vendor needs to assume data is bad and provide workflows to fix it
  * Question: Should dicom on disk be kept up to date, or leave it dirty and have DB be the master?
    * Answer: IMO, the data on disk should be kept up to date, the DB should not be authoritative
  * Question: Should you keep the original DICOM as received?
    * Answer: Yes, although maybe exception for pixel data
  * Question: What are the options to do indexed look ups on Study Level Attributes (patient name, patient id, study date)
    * RDBMS
      * Pros: Everyone knows how to use them, ACID transactions, good query support, can do more complex queries than CFIND (e.g. operational analytics)
      * Cons: Expensive (probably)
    * NoSQL
      * Pros: More scalable than RDBMS, more cost effective (probably) than RDBMS, good enough query support
      * Cons: Does not have ACID transactions (probably), harder to add indexes (depends on implementation)
    * In memory indexes (redis, in RAM with language)
      * Pros: Super fast, can scale with sharding, can do updates atomically (probably)
      * Cons: How to store on disk?
    * Object Storage Attributes
      * Pros: no additional tech - feature of object storage
      * Cons: Indexable (probably?)
    * FHIR (ImagingStudy document)
      * Pros: keeping DICOM metadata up to date not as big an issue (FHIR is authoritative)
      * Cons: hard dependency on FHIR
*
