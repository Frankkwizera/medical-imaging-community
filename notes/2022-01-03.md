This one I think you mean - http://www.pacscalculator.com/
STEVEN BORG to Everyone (10:05 AM)
Yep, that's the one!
Sandor dr Konya to Everyone (10:18 AM)
cardiology fluoroscopy / qngio suite images can be incredibly huge.

Thatâ€™s just a volume distribution for a large academic site. Not storage size.
Brad Genereaux to Everyone (10:20 AM)
One of my favorite articles looking at business models in medical imaging; focuses on AI but the concepts can be somewhat generally applied - https://www.signifyresearch.net/medical-imaging/business-models-ai-medical-imaging/

ok
STEVEN BORG to Everyone (10:24 AM)
Thanks!
Simon Rascovsky to Everyone (10:26 AM)
Thereâ€™s a lot of variability in reading volumes per rad and modality. this is a yearâ€™s worth for an institution with ~500,000/year, 150+ rads:

STEVEN BORG to Everyone (10:28 AM)
@Jean-Francois, you make an EXCELLENT point.  I've considered it, but was looking at 3x retrieval per first year (then down to 1/2 year), not 7x.  Is 7x per first year?
Jean-Francois Pambrun to Everyone (10:30 AM)
This ~7x figure is from historical data. Counting coordinator, QA, residents, viewing priors etc. I don't know about the average timelines.
STEVEN BORG to Everyone (10:32 AM)
Thank you!
Very valuable
@simon, what is the X-axis on your graph.
Jean-Francois Pambrun to Everyone (10:36 AM)
pay per view means shifting a big part of the risk on the consumer.. a likely though sell..
Simon Rascovsky to Everyone (10:37 AM)
@steve: Itâ€™s individual radiologists at that org.
STEVEN BORG to Everyone (10:37 AM)
Got it!  Thanks!
Sandor dr Konya to Everyone (10:40 AM)
how would industry solve research purpose study retrievals?  ðŸ¤”  if I would like to access 100k xrays for a classification problem, it would cost a fortune from cloud wouldn't it?
Daniel Mwambi to Everyone (10:41 AM)
PACS-coin ðŸ˜…
Danyell Wilt to Everyone (10:42 AM)
Sd - Do the research in the cloud rather than egressing the data? You can do the classification using resources in the cloud without needing to move the dataset.
Jean-Francois Pambrun to Everyone (10:42 AM)
do your ml in the same cloud so you don't have to pay egress
Sandor dr Konya to Everyone (10:43 AM)
oh, so I pay then for computation too...
beautiful future for self initiated research =/
Jean-Francois Pambrun to Everyone (10:46 AM)
you need money to make real research on pixel data.. v100 GPUs or whatever are few $ per hours and you can spin up/down in few seconds..
Jean-Francois Pambrun to Everyone (10:47 AM)
engineer cost 70-100+$/hr, you should be able to pay few dollars per hours for GPUs

Could point of care ultrasound replace the stethoscope in the future?
Danyell Wilt to Everyone (10:51 AM)
Locums work
Sandor dr Konya to Everyone (10:52 AM)
the problem is not the few bucks / hours... rather the time. now I can buy a few rtx30XX for some thousand $ that run 7/24 for few years and can get the job done... run a cloud computation (amd re run 100x) ... noone can afford it in the long run.
Simon Rascovsky to Everyone (10:53 AM)
@Daniel, the stethoscope, it could but itâ€™s also much more complex to use, more expensive and there are hundreds of years of common knowledge on chest sounds that is useful.

Jean-Francois Pambrun to Everyone (10:54 AM)
8gb of VRAM is limiting for one. Seconddly, you could wait a year with 4000$ of consumer GPU or spend a few grand over night and get the result the next morning..
Sandor dr Konya to Everyone (10:55 AM)
sure, I agree, thats an option and if the research has unlimited funds is the way to go =)

you (and academia) consider your time not to be worth enough IMO
